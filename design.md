Why shared ownership
====================

We use shared ownership for all handles inside the layer for multiple reasons:
- when not doing so we would have to do a lot more tracking manually.
  For instance, we want to show the image belonging to an image view in
  the overlay, allowing to directly jump to inspect it. But an image may
  be legally destroyed before an image view. So we would have to explicitly
  unregister the image from all image views on destruction (but this is
  not even what we want, if the image view is still alive we want to get
  information about the image it was created with, even if that was destroyed).
  	- Well, the example with image and image view isn't entirely clear. It's
	  much more common with command buffers: Most vulkan applications have
	  at one point command buffers in invalid state laying around (that won't
	  be used like that anymore but re-recorded before the next use). How
	  should the overlay handle them? Don't show them at all? Show them but
	  just display them as "invalid"? But we actually want to display a history
	  of submitted vulkan commands.

Ok, wait, do we really? Is displaying a history worth all the struggle?
Just displaying the command buffer as "being in invalid state so we don't
show its contents" sounds pretty sensible to me.
